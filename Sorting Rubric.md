# Madlibs Program - Rubric

## Name:  Selim Abdelwahab

### Environment

I used *JavaFX* to complete this assignment.

### Sorting Algorithm

I implemented a visualizer for the Bubble Sort algorithm

### Self Evaluation

I believe that my program deserves a level 4+ because through my program I was able to showcase a sorting algorithim in a fun way. The alogorithm I chose to use is Insertion sort. With that I created a pleasent to look at UI and I also added some rather nice scene transition animation along with animations that show rectangles switching places. I also added many functionalities for the user. They can step through one iteration, they can auto sort and change the speed, they can reset the sort, they can randomize the array, and they can reverse the direction of the sorting. I also added an information section that displays how many rectangles are present, how many comparisons are remaining, which iteration of the rectangle we're on, and which rectangle it's comparing to. The user can also see if the comparison was true and if the sort is complete. Other than that I also made a nice visual representation of which rectangles have been sorted and which haven't, the opacity change highlights which rectangles are being checked. Lastly, in the home screen the user can adjust the number of rectangles they want displayed.
